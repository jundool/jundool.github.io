        Did you know that there is a way to add a 25th word to increase security when using a hard wallet?<br><br>

Please note that I have not yet used a hard wallet, so I have no direct experience using it.<br>
Since the seed phrase is very important when using a hard wallet, I am writing to let you know that this function exists.<br>
This article was written based on searched data.<br>

To increase the security of your hard wallet, you can add a 25th word.<br>
The 25th word means adding an additional word of the optional passphrase to the basic 24 word seed.<br> This option is available when generating new seeds using certain Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP39) compatible wallets.<br><br>

To understand what the 25th word is, you first need to know what the first 24 words mean.<br> Most hardware and software wallets that comply with BIP39 generate a list of 24 words.<br> This is from a list of 2048 powerful words.<br> This list of words represents the root seed in mnemonic form.<br><br>

A mnemonic is a system of letters, ideas, or associative patterns that help you remember something.<br>
The BIP39 root seed is an encrypted alphanumeric code that is 128 characters long.<br><br>

This root seed is derived from 24 words and is interchangeable.<br>

Unlike the first 24 words, the 25th word does not appear in the used words list.<br> This is actually a custom password of your choosing.<br> Hardware wallets such as Trezor, Ledger nano S, and DCENT have the ability to add a 25th word.<br> The purpose of adding this additional passphrase is to further encrypt the root seed.<br> If 24 words are compromised, anyone holding those words will need the 25th word to access the root key.<br> Even without this 25th word, the key is safe.<br><br>

Encryption that provides a 24-word phrase is very secure.<br> The problem is that if these 24 words are exposed, your wallet assets will be lost.<br> The 25th word adds an additional layer of security.<br><br>

Adding a new word to the mnemonic creates an entirely new root key, from which new public keys, private keys,<br> and addresses are derived.<br> If you set up your wallet with 24 words and later generate a 25th word, your wallet will hold two separate root keys.<br> If you really want, you can create multiple 25th words.<br><br>

I have already explained that the 25th word provides an additional layer of security.<br> You might think it's safer to have two "accounts" on your hardware wallet.<br><br>

Accounts without the 25th word can function as sub-account wallets.<br>
The 25-word account can be a kind of basic account. A true cold wallet.<br><br>

Another reason may be confidentiality. If you are the target of a crime.<br> If a ransom is demanded, you can choose to reveal your wallet without the 25th word.<br> Of course, the biggest assets are stored in the 25th word wallet.<br><br>

Although 24-word encryption is already a strong and secure way to manage your private keys,<br> we believe that a 25-word setting is much more secure in most cases.<br> It is important to store your 25th word safely and conveniently.<br><br>

There are currently two convenient ways to store the 25th word.<br> One is to simply memorize it.<br> It's almost impossible for this to damage your funds, but there's a risk of forgetting about it.<br> 
An alternative is to store the 25th word in a different location.<br><br>

BIP39's 24-word formula was created by the smartest cryptocurrency experts,<br> carefully finding the right balance between security and inconvenience.<br> <br>

Instead of implementing additional security measures yourself, it's wise to adhere to the guidelines crafted by experts.<br><br>

Once again, please be aware of the above<br> and try various methods with small amounts to ensure a safe transfer before transferring a large amount.
