        <p style="font-size: 20x;">About impermanent lossâ€¦</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20x;">Impermanent loss is an important concept within liquidity pools.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20x;">This is because there is a difference in potential profit or loss between keeping your coins in a pool and keeping them in your wallet.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20x;">This concept comes to life when you withdraw from a pool based on the price difference between the coins within the pool and their external market value.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20x;">It is a complex function that is affected by various factors such as the timing of price change between two coins and the rate of price change.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20x;">This will help you determine whether the potential return from fees + compensation outweighs the risk of impermanent loss.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20x;">Truly understanding impermanent loss requires understanding complex concepts and variables that cannot be fully captured in simplified explanations.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20x;">It is beyond my ability to explain this in detail.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20x;">Let me explain with a very simple example.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20x;">approximately As of this writing, 1 XLM is equal to 22 SSLX (values of $0.12 and $0.0054 respectively).
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20x;">Initial investment: $24</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20x;">100 XLM + 2200 SSLX = $12 + $12 = $24</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20x;">Assume that the value of XLM doubles while SSLX remains constant.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20x;">The value of XLM has doubled to $0.24, while SSLX remains at $0.0054.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20x;">Only XLM increased by 100%, so now XLM is 100*0.24=24$.
            SSLX price remains the same at $12, so it will be adjusted to $36.</p>
         <p style="font-size: 20x;">So in the liquidity pool, they are adjusted at a nearly 1:1 ratio, at about $18 each.</p>
         <p style="font-size: 20x;">As a result, in this hypothetical example, the value of the pool increases from $24 to $36 after the price change.</p>
         <p style="font-size: 20x;">Pool re-evaluation after XLM price increase:</p>   
         <p style="font-size: 20x;">$18=75 XLM * $0.24</p>
         <p style="font-size: 20x;">$18=3311 SSLX * $0.0054</p>
         <p style="font-size: 20x;">The new value of the pool after the price change is $36.</p>
         <p style="font-size: 20x;">However, if the initial 200 XLM had not been placed in the liquidity pool, the $24 invested in XLM alone would have doubled to $48.</p>
         <p style="font-size: 20x;">So the impermanent loss makes a difference of $12.</p>
         <p style="font-size: 20x;">To summarize here (assuming SSLX values remain constant):</p>
         <p style="font-size: 20x;">The XLM value remains constant and the SSLX value remains constant. - XLM quantity will remain the same and SSLX quantity will remain the same.</p>
         <p style="font-size: 20x;">The XLM value increases and the SSLX value remains constant. - XLM quantity decreases and SSLX quantity increases.</p>
         <p style="font-size: 20x;">The XLM value decreases and the SSLX value remains constant. - XLM quantity increases and SSLX quantity decreases.</p>
         <p style="font-size: 20x;">If the value of SSLX, which has remained constant, begins to decline,
         It may fall further from $36, resulting in additional losses.</p>
         <p style="font-size: 20x;">
         <p style="font-size: 20x;">It is important to note that impermanent losses will occur if the percentage of tokens in the liquidity pool changes due to price fluctuations.</p>
         <p style="font-size: 20x;">The greater the price difference between tokens, the greater the impermanent loss.</p>
         <p style="font-size: 20x;">This is a risk that must be considered when providing liquidity to such pools.</p>
